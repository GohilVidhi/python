    "# 1. Easy to Code :\n",
    "#     -Python is a very high-level programming language, yet it is effortless to learn. \n",
    "#     -Anyone can learn to code in Python in just a few hours or a few days.\n",
    "#     -the basic Python syntax is very easy, as compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Easy to Read :\n",
    "#     -Python code looks like simple English words.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3. Free and Open-Source :\n",
    "#     -it is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. \n",
    "#      It doesn't cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application. \n",
    "#      It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. \n",
    "#      Python can be downloaded from the official website = \"www.python.org/downloads\".\n",
    "     \n",
    "# 4. Interpreted :\n",
    "#     -When a programming language is interpreted, it means that the source code is executed line by line, and not all at once. \n",
    "#      Programming languages such as C++ or Java are not interpreted, and hence need to be compiled first to run them.\n",
    "#      There is no need to compile Python because it is processed at runtime by the interpreter.\n",

    "#     -Python is portable in the sense that the same code can be used on different machines. \n",
    "#      Suppose you write a Python code on a Mac. If you want to run it on Windows or Linux later, you don’t have to make any \n",

    "     \n",
    "# 6. Object-Oriented programing :\n",
    "#     -in Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. \n",
    "#      It aims to implement real-world entities like Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Data Abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Expressive :\n",
    "#     -Python needs to use only a few lines of code to perform complex tasks. \n",
    "#      For example, to display Hello World, you simply need to type one line - print(“Hello World”). Other languages like Java  \n",
    "#      or C would take up multiple lines to execute this.\n",

    "# 8. Support for GUI (Graphical User Interface) :\n",
    "#     -One of the key aspects of any programming language is support for GUI. \n",
    "#      A user can easily interact with the software using a GUI. Python offers various toolkits, such as Tkinter, wxPython and \n",
    "#      JPython, which allows for GUI's easy and fast development."
